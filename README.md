# Variables and Functions

## Overview
This lab was about practicing JavaScript basics like variables and functions and conditional logic. I learned how to write functions that take parameters, return values, and include conditions to make them dynamic.

I also added a few checks to make sure the inputs were valid before performing calculations or returning results.

## Learnings

I have learned and created functions to
- Format full name with proper capitalization
- Calculate total cost with price, quantity and tax
- Checking eligibility based on age and employment status
- Refactor the total cost function to include an optional discount
I have learned to use if.. and else conditions to handle the different situations.

# Reflection Questions
1. How did you approach creating more flexible functions with parameters?
- I made sure each function could accept parameter so I could reuse the same function for different inputs instead of hardcording numbers.

2. What challenges did you face while incorporating conditional logic in your functions?
- I forgot to handle invalid inputs like empty strings. I have used simple checks with the if.. statements to make only valid data was processed.
3. How does refactoring improve the readability and maintainability of your code?
- Refactoring helped make my code clean and easy to understand. I combined repeated steps into one place, renamed variables to be clear, and made functions that can be reused later instead of rewriting code.
